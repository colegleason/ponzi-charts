Earlier this week, a website called [ponzi.io](http://ponzi.io) sprung up. It was a completely transparent
Ponzi scheme: you put in BTC and get 120% of your investment out. A few people tried it, and it worked.

By Feb. 9th it hit HN and the amount of BTC pouring in grew like crazy. A total of 347.6958386 BTC went through
their address [1ponziUjuCVdB167ZmTWH48AURW1vE64q](https://blockchain.info/address/1ponziUjuCVdB167ZmTWH48AURW1vE64q).

The operators shut the site down, but all the data is still out there thanks to the public Bitcoin blockchain. It's
pretty rare that we, the public, have access to the exact structure of a Ponzi scheme, so let's take a look!
